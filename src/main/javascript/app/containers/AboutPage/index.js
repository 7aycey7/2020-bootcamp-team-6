                                 pet overpopulation by means of spay and neuter and community outreach.
                                 
                                 Our measurable impact is demonstrated by the fact that over 93% of clients who graduate from the shelter, receive Rapid Re-Housing funding, 
                                 and continue on with our community case management program remain in permanent housing during their first year out of the shelter, which is a very vulnerable time.</p>

                                     We are open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, and we served more than 840 men, women and children in fiscal year 2020. 
                                    Today, we offer a 60-bed emergency shelter with rigorous case management, education, employment and housing services; a day shelter (Davidâ€™s Place) that addresses the basic needs of chronically homeless individuals; the City of Alexandria Winter Shelter run from November to April; and a Community Case Management (CCM) program that continues to support clients who have graduated from the shelter for a minimum of one year.
